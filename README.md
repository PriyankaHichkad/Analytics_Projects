This repository showcases a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling using tools like Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, R Programming, Power BI and more. Each project is designed to explore the datasets, extract meaningful insights, and communicate findings effectively. 

Through these projects, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience in the complete data analysis lifecycle - from data collection and preprocessing to insight generation and visualization. Working with diverse datasets has sharpened my ability to identify patterns, trends, and correlations, and strengthened my understanding of how to ask the right questions and draw meaningful conclusions from raw data. I’ve also improved my proficiency in using analytical tools and libraries, learned to handle messy or incomplete data, and developed a deeper appreciation for the role of data storytelling in making results accessible and actionable for different audiences.
