This repository is a collection of Data Analysis projects showcasing skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical modeling.
This repository highlights my journey in extracting insights from raw data, presenting findings effectively, and communicating results through impactful storytelling.

## Overview:
These projects cover the complete data analysis lifecycle, including:
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, cleaning messy datasets, feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, correlations, and hidden patterns in datasets.
- **Visualization:** Creating clear and interactive plots to communicate results.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Applying hypothesis testing, regression, and basic predictive techniques.
- **Data Storytelling:** Making data-driven insights accessible and actionable for diverse audiences.

## Tools & Technologies:
The following tools and libraries are used extensively across the projects:
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R
- **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI
- **Statistical Techniques:** Regression, Hypothesis Testing, Correlation Analysis
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, Git/GitHub

## Projects Included:
Some of the key projects consolidated in this repository are:
- **Hotel Bookings Analysis (R Programming)** → Analyzed booking patterns, cancellations, and customer preferences using R.
- **MI vs CSK 2024 Cricket Match Analysis (Python)** → Match insights, player performance trends, and visual breakdown using Jupyter Notebook.
- **Retail Store Transaction Analysis (RFM Analysis, Python)** → Customer segmentation and purchasing behavior analysis through Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
- **Sentiment Analysis on McDonald’s Reviews (Python)** → Extracted customer sentiment and opinions using NLP techniques.
- **Mumbai Restaurant Data Cleaning & Analysis (Python)** → Preprocessed raw data and derived insights into restaurant trends and customer preferences.
- **Interactive Dashboard on Mumbai Restaurant Data (Power BI)** → Built a dynamic dashboard for visualization and decision-making from the cleaned dataset.
- **Case Competition-IIMBodhGaya (PDF Report)** → Market analysis and strategic solutions for a hypothetical company’s expansion in Tier-3 cities.
(More projects continuously added...)

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/PriyankaHichkad/Analytics_Projects.git
